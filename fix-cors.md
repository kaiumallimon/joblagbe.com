When you're trying to load images from **Firebase Storage** in a **Flutter Web** app using `Image.network`, and the images are **not loading due to CORS issues**, it's because **Firebase Storage requires proper CORS configuration** to allow web apps from different origins to access those resources.

### ✅ Solution: Set up CORS for Firebase Storage

You need to configure Firebase Storage CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) rules correctly.

### 🔧 Steps to Fix CORS for Firebase Storage

#### 1. **Create a CORS configuration file (cors.json)**

Here’s a safe default CORS config that allows your web app to load images:

```json
[
  {
    "origin": ["*"],
    "method": ["GET"],
    "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```

> 🔐 If your app is in production, you should replace `*` with your actual domain (e.g., `"https://your-app.web.app"` or `"http://localhost:8000"` for local dev).

---

#### 2. **Install Firebase CLI (if not already)**

If you haven’t installed it:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

Login to Firebase:

```bash
firebase login
```

---

#### 3. **Apply the CORS config to Firebase Storage**

Run the following command in the directory where `cors.json` is saved:

```bash
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://portfolio-website-fb970.appspot.com
```


If you don’t have `gsutil` installed, you can [install the Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

### 🚀 After Setup

Once you’ve set the CORS rules:

* Wait a few minutes for the rules to propagate.
* Then reload your Flutter web app and the images from Firebase Storage should start loading correctly via `Image.network`.

---

### 🧪 Optional Debug

If you're still having issues:

* Open **DevTools** in your browser (F12 > Network tab).
* Look for the failed image request.
* See if the error is a `CORS` error (like `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'` header).

Let me know if you want help crafting a more secure CORS config (e.g., limited to just `GET` from your domain).
